This course has four modules, which include: coursework (including computer and teacher-graded assignments), discussion-based assessments (a meeting with your teacher), and module exams. There is no high-stakes final exam; just shorter incremental exams in each module, two of which must be scheduled with a proctor.\u00a0\u00a0While other Flex courses contain pre-tests that allow students to test out of additional practice, this class does not have additional practice due to the nature of the computer application work assigned.\u00a0\u00a0This course is designed to teach students the essential skill of touch-typing using modern tools and interactive lessons. By leveraging the Typesy platform, students will progressively build their typing speed, accuracy, and fluency through guided practice, structured drills, and engaging activities.
