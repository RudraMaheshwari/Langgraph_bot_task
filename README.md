# Key Features of the Converted System:

## 1. LangGraph Integration:
- **StateGraph**: Manages conversation flow with defined states and transitions
- **State Schema**: Typed state management with reducers for complex data types
- **ReAct Agent**: Uses create_react_agent for tool-based reasoning

## 2. State Management:
- **CourseRecommenderState**: Comprehensive state schema with all conversation data
- **State Reducers**: Custom reducers for interests and messages
- **Memory**: Built into the state graph, no separate memory buffer needed

## 3. Tool-Based Architecture:
- **Course Retriever**: Vector-based course search tool
- **Interest Extractor**: LLM-powered interest identification
- **Conversation Manager**: Context-aware response generation
- **Recommendation Generator**: Personalized course suggestions

## 4. Graph-Based Flow:
- **Entry Point**: Process user input
- **Interest Extraction**: Continuous interest identification
- **Response Generation**: Context-aware responses
- **Conditional Logic**: Stage-based conversation flow

## 5. Enhanced Features:
- **Message Filtering**: Recent message management
- **Grade-Appropriate Responses**: Age-appropriate conversation tones
- **Credit Type Filtering**: Dual credit, regular credit preferences
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery at each step

## 6. API Compatibility:
- **Flask Integration**: Same REST API endpoints
- **Session Management**: User state persistence
- **Chat History**: Complete conversation tracking

This conversion maintains all the original functionality while leveraging LangGraph's superior state management, tool integration, and conversation flow control. The system is now more modular, maintainable, and extensible.
